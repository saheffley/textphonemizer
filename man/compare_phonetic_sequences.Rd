\usage{
compare_phonetic_sequences(text1, text2, dict_path = "phonetic_dictionary.csv")
}
\arguments{
\item{text1}{a text string for the first sentence}

\item{text2}{a text string for the second sentence}

\item{dict_path}{path to the local phonetic dictionary file}
}
\value{
a list containing:
\describe{
\item{total_edit_distance}{the Levenshtein edit distance between the two text sequences.}
\item{seq1}{the phonetic sequence for the first sentence.}
\item{seq2}{the phonetic sequence for the second sentence.}
}
}
\description{
Function to compute the Levenshtein edit distance between two IPA (international phonetic alphabet) strings.
Will produce collapsed phonetic sequences for two text sequences and the edit distance (i.e., differences between the sequences without distinguishing between error types).
}
